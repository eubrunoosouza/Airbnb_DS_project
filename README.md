# Analysis of Airbnb Data (Edinburgh/Scotland).

This project was an exploratory data analysis, focused on storytelling(I used Python coding language) from a dataset provided by Airbnb.
A very cool initiative by Airbnb is the availability of real data from some of the main cities in the world, from its platform. This is possible through the portal: Inside Airbnb, where it is possible to directly download a large amount of data to develop Data Science projects and solutions.

This project was only possible because this initiative! Thanks!
